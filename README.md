# WHMCS Paytrail Payment Gateway

## Summary

Payment Gateway modules allow you to integrate payment solutions with the WHMCS platform.

# Paytrail Payment Module for WHMCS

Accept credit card or bank payments with Paytrail (formerly Suomen Verkkomaksut). Paytrail allows you to offer each customer their preferred payment method. Their service contains online banking buttons to all Finnish banks, a card payment option, invoice option, and the all-new Paytrail account. Stop losing sales because customers cannot select their payment method of choice!

Paytrail is the leading e-payment method provider in Finland, and is expanding globally. While using Paytrail you don’t need contracts directly and separately with every bank – you get them all with one contract! This plugin works by redirecting the client to Paytrail to choose their payment method, then sending them back to your site once payment is complete.

## Why Choose Paytrail?

    Accept credit card and bank account payments through your site
    Avoid security concerns since payments are processed through Paytrail
    Accept Visa®, MasterCard®, bank payments, and more
    Paytrail is the only company specializing in e-payments that is licensed by Fin-FSA.

## Secure Payment Processing

During the WHMCS checkout, customers select Paytrail to pay and click “Place Order”. The customer is then directed off-site to select their preferred payment method and to make their payment through Paytrail’s secure servers, and then is redirected back to your site. This allows you to accept multiple forms of payment and with several banks all in one easy, secure checkout integration.

## Installtion Steps

    Download the modules directory or Git clone the modules directory to root directory of WHMCS installtion.
    Upload the module folder into <whmcs_root> directory, and it will be placed <whmcs_root>/modules/gateways/.

## Setup

Begin by activating the payment gateway under Setup > Payments > Payment Gateways and choose Paytrail from the Available Gateways dropdown.
